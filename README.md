# phi4 Instruct on Google Colab

In this project I worked with open source Phi4 model that can understand image and text at the same time. 

I downloaded the model on google colab and tested it with a pie chart to see if it can understand image. 

I uploaded jupyter notebook on this repository, but its better if you open it on google colab to get GPU support,
